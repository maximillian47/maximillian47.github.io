Input, storage, processing and output are what make a computer computer.
Text, image and sound can all be represented by binary codes. 
Wires and circuits carry all the information in a computer. 
A simple circuit takes an electric signal and flips it. Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different results. 
Logic gates include AND, NOT, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR. Electricity moves at just about the speed of light. Modern Circuits can perform billions of calculations per second.Â
