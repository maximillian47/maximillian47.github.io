* Ajax refers to a groupof technologies that allow you to update just one part of the page (rather than reload a whole page). 
* You can incorporate HTML, XML, or JSON data into your pages. (JSON is becoming increasingly popular.)
* To load JSON from a different domain, you can use JSONP but only if the code is from a trusted source. 
* jQuery has methods that make it easier to use Ajax. 
* .load() is the simplest way to load HTML into your pages and allows you to update just a part of the page. 
* .ajax() is more powerful and more complex. (Several shorthand methods are also offered.) 
* It is important to consider how the site will work if the user does not have JavaScript enabled, or if the page is not able to access the data from a server. 
* Breakpoints: You can pause the execution of a script on any line using breakpoints. Then you can check the values stored in variables at that point in time. 
* If you set multiple breakpoints, you can step through them one-by-one to see where values change and a problem might occur.
* You can indicate that a breakpoint should be triggered only if a condition that you specify is met. The condition can use existing variables. 
* If you know your code might fail, use try, catch, and finally. Each one is given its own code block. 
* If you know something might cause a problem for you script, you can generate your own errors before the interpreter creates them. 
* Content panels allow you to showcase extra information within a limited space. In this chapter, you will see several examples of a content panels that also give you practical insight into creating your own scripts using jQuery.
