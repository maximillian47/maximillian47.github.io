It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own Javascript file. 
JavaScript files are text files(like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.
The HTML<script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file(rather like the <link>element can be used to load a CSS file).
If you view the source code of the page in the browser , the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created. 
Here are 6 rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
1) The name must begin with a letter, a dollar sign or an underscore. It must not start with a number.
2) The name can obtain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore. Must not use a dash or a period in a variable name.
3) Cannot use keywords or reserved words. 
4) All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names. 
5) Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. 
6) Use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
