Loops

For: If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop

While: If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop

Do While: The do...while loop is very similar to the while loop, but has one key difference: it'll always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once., even if the condition evaluates to false.
