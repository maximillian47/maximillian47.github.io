* APIs are used in browsers, scripts, and by websites that share functionality with other programs or sites. 
* APIs let you write code that will make a request, asking another program or script to do something. 
* APIs also specify the format in which the response will be given(so that the response can be understood). 
* To use an API on your website, you will need to include a script in the relevant web pages. 
* An API's documentation will usually feature tables of objects, methods, and properties.
* Providing you know how to create an object and call its methods, access its properties, and respond to its events, you should be able to learn any JavaScript API.
