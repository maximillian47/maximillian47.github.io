* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. 
* DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
* You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a NodeList.
* From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 
* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
