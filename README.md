*Growth Mindset*

In my opinion, growth mindset is the ability to continuously learn and absorb knowledge, while also being adaptive to the constantly-changing work/study environment. 


**~~4~~3 reminders:**
```
- Always stay hungry for knowledge
- Always keep an open mind
- Always pay close attention to the trend of modern technology
